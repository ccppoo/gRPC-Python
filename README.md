# gRPC-Python-QuickStart

clean gRPC-Python start kit

Simple working exmample for Python gRPC

Because [example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) given from the
[gRPC offical site](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/) is too large to handle for those who just want to make with python.

I will add my own sample and also cover most of the examples from [gRPC repository](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/examples/python)

## 1. Hello World - from [gRPC/gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)

Basic example from [gRPC/gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)
